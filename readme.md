# Casino Society Website Base

## Overview
This is the foundational structure for the "Casino Society" website, built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. It's designed for high traffic (millions of visitors), with optimizations for performance, SEO, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and mobile-first responsiveness. The theme incorporates luxury casino elements like gradients, subtle animations (e.g., hover flips), and a color palette of blacks, golds, reds, and whites.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or Download**: Get the files (index.html, about.html, etc., styles.css, script.js).
2. **Serve Locally**: Use a local server like `live-server` (npm install -g live-server) or open in browser (but some features like video may need a server).
3. **Dependencies**: No external frameworks. Google Fonts are linked in HTML for typography.
4. **Images/Videos**: Replace placeholders (e.g., `placeholder-image1.webp`, `hero-video.mp4`) with actual assets. Use WebP for images and optimize with tools like ImageOptim.
5. **Testing**: Check cross-browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices. Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools for audits.

## How to Customize
- **Content**: Replace placeholders like `<!-- Add your hero image here -->` or text excerpts with real content.
- **Theming**: Edit CSS variables in `:root` (e.g., colors, fonts).
- **Add Features**:
  - API Integrations: Use comments in script.js for fetching data (e.g., blog posts, forums).
  - Analytics: Uncomment Google Analytics in HTML heads.
  - Maps: Add Google Maps iframe or JS in contact.html's `#map-placeholder`.
  - Forms: Enhance submission with fetch() in script.js.
  - Animations: Expand casino-themed effects, like full card flips using CSS 3D transforms.
  - Monetization: Add ad scripts (e.g., Google AdSense) in placeholders.
  - SEO: Update meta tags, add real structured data, generate sitemap.xml and robots.txt.
- **Modular CSS**: Uses BEM naming for easy extension (e.g., `.header__logo`).
- **JS Enhancements**: Add more interactivity, like carousel auto-slide or live search.

## Deployment Tips
- **Hosting**: Use Vercel, Netlify, or AWS for scalability. Enable CDN for assets.
- **Performance**: Minify CSS/JS (use tools like cssnano, uglify-js). Enable HTTPS.
- **SEO**: Submit sitemap to Google Search Console. Use canonical tags.
- **Scalability**: For millions of visitors, integrate a backend (e.g., Node.js) for dynamic content. Add caching (e.g., Cloudflare).
- **Security**: Ensure HTTPS, validate all inputs server-side.
